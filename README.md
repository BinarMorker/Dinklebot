# Dinklebot
Your personal companion for tracking and showing your Guardians

## Project
Dinklebot is a project I started when my friend and I created a clan for Destiny. 
We thought it would be a good idea to have a website, and we made it happen. 
Afterwards, what was supposed to be a simple character preview for our website became a more complex character stats app. 
After seeing how much the public Destiny API was offering, I wanted to use the most of it and show relevant information to the players. 
I decided to scrap the original website to replace it entirely with the new project, keeping the clan's name too. 
However, I recently decided to make a complete rehaul of the website and that's when I decided to change the project's 
name to Dinklebot. This is how this project came to life.
